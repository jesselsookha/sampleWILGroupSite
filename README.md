# 🧪 Git Collaboration Simulation

## 🎯 Overview

This repository is part of an in-class Git collaboration activity. Students will work in teams to simulate a real-world developer workflow using GitHub, feature branches, pull requests, and conflict resolution.

Each team is tasked with building a simple 3-page website:
- `index.html`
- `about.html`
- `contact.html`

## 👩‍💻 Purpose

This activity serves as a hands-on introduction to Git:
- Learn the **branch-based workflow** commonly used in tech projects.
- Understand how to **collaborate and contribute** to a shared codebase.
- Practice submitting and reviewing **pull requests**, just like in open-source or workplace teams.
- Gain exposure to **merge conflicts** and how to resolve them.
- Begin logging your work through a **Timesheet**, helping you reflect on your contributions.

## 🪴 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this simulation, students should be able to:
- Create and clone a GitHub repository
- Work on a feature branch and push changes
- Open and review pull requests
- Merge contributions into a shared repository
- Resolve Git conflicts collaboratively
- Begin maintaining a record of work for future projects

## 🚀 What's Next?

This activity sets the stage for your **real project**, where collaboration and code management become central to your success. The skills practiced here will directly support the group development, version control, and contribution processes in your next major assignment.
